# Visit-Austin-Website-Pages

This is my first ever website I created on my own. It was created in late 2020 and only uses HTML and CSS. This includes the styling of the layout, the navigation bar, the links, all things pertaining to font, and the footer information. 

In addition, there are many external links being used and these range from hotels to restaurants to bars and clubs. 

Since this is my first website I worked on, I have used this site as a gauge indicator to see where I was when I was first starting out and comparing that to where I am now in terms of my experiene I have gained along with preferential tendencies that I used back then in my code versus what I prefer to use now. 

There are no current plans to update this site as I strictly want to keep it in its original state so that I can continue to reflect on how I continue to grow as a developer.
