			<h2><strong>Spring</strong></h2>
			<p>Spring in Austin is characterized by very pleasant temperatures ranging from the low 70s in March to the mid 80s in May. May is the wettest<br>
			month in Austin with precipitation totals averaging nearly 4.5 inches of rain in the month. Spring also does bring in the chance for some severe<br>
			weather to the area. Austin lies at the exterme southern end of Tornado Valley and due to this and the Texas Hill Country that borders the <br>
			western part of the city, tornadoes are very rare. More common though are thunderstorms which can cause significant damage to parts of the city.<br>
			Spring also brings in one of the biggest events for Austin each year: South By Southwest. The large outdoor music festival lasts from March 16-20<br>
			and is located in Zilker Park and attracts massive throngs of music lovers.</p>

			<h2><strong>Summer</strong></h2>
			<p>Austin is well known for its heat during the summer months. Temperatures can easily reach into the 90s during peak summer, including average<br>
			highs of 95 and 97 degrees in July and August. On average, Austin experiences 116 days of days at least 90 degrees or warmer and, of those 116,<br>
			18 of them include temperatures that exceed 100 degrees. One unique aspect of Ausin's weather during the warmer months is its relative humidity.<br>
			The flow of the humidty levels are dependant on either the warm, moist air that comes from the Gulf of Mexico or the drier and lower humidity levels<br>
			that care associated with West Texas and northern parts of Mexico. The biggest event that takes place during the summer months is Austin's pride month<br>
			which is in August and includes a large parade that marches through downtown.</p>

			<h2><strong>Autumn</strong></h2>
			<p>Similar to the spring time, autumn in Austin is very pleasant with the temperatures having cooled off significantly since the summer months.<br>
			Autumn can also present the possibility of increased severe weather thanks to the transitioning of the seasons, however, as mentioned above, Austin<br>
			tends to suffer from thunderstorms than it does tornadoes. The largest event that takes place in the city during this time of the year is the<br>
			Austin City Limits Music Festival which takes place in early and mid October. Although not as large or as well known as SXSW, the ACL Festival<br>
			draws in large crowds in itself.</p>

			<h2><strong>Winter</strong></h2>
			<p>Winters in Austin are pleasant and cool with temperatures topping out around 62 degrees in both December and January. Austin does not typically<br>
			get snow, although trace amounts are occaisonally recorded. Instead, the city usually suffers from an ice storm roughly every two years. This ice<br>
			can be crippling for its citizens to drive in as they are not used to snowy and icy conditions. Temperatures rarely ever dip below freezing, however,<br>
			overnight lows can easily drop into the upper 30s which allows for frost to accumulate throughout the area. The Zilker Holiday Tree is the major<br>
			attraction during the winter months and takes place at Zilker Park on November 29.</p>
