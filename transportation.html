				<p>Austin is primarily served for its air travel by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The airport is serviced by 19 airline carriers and
				travles to four international countries as well. Located to the southeast of downtown, the airport is relatively small comapared to			
				some of the other airports in Texas and is easy to navigate thanks to one large terminal building.</p>

				<p>The main thoroughfare in Austin is I-35 which runs north-south and travels along the eastern side of downtown and East Austin. The other
				main arterial road that traverses the western half of the city in a north-south alignment is the MoPac Expressway. Other highways include
				U.S. Highway 290, 71, 183 and 290. Despite the abundance of several highways throughout the city, Austin still suffers from heavy traffic
				which is comparable to other cities such as Los Angeles, Boston and Philadelphia in terms of congestion.</p>

				<p>Public transportation is found in the city in the form of Capital Metro, primarily in the form of a bus system. In 2010, a light rail
				system was launched and was able to handle more people looking to travel around the city. In addition to Capital Metro, there are also
				scooters that people can use for a speedy travel around the city's roads for a low price.</p>

				<p>Ride sharing is a popular way of getting around in Austin. Both Uber and Lyft are available frequently and provide a convenient and
				affordable way of getting around. Just a quick trip using a ride sharing app can allow someone to go from downtown to the South Austin
				area or from the outskirts of the city to the urban core. Zipcar and Austin B-Cycle are other forms of ride sharing available.</p>

				<p>Austin is a very popular city for cyclists and is known as the most bike-friendly city in Texas. It is a quick, easy and affordable
				way of getting around the city. Austin is also very walkable, coming in 35th place out of 50 cities in the United States. Downtown is
				very simple to walk around as the city has a tight urban core and lacks a lot of the urban sprawl that is seen more in cities like
				Dallas and Houston, thus making it much more navigable.</p>
