			<p><strong>The South Congress Avenue Bridge</strong> is well known for the show that takes place underneath it every evening from late March to early fall.<br>
			The bats, which live in large colonies leave their roosts and fly out amoungst the sky in downtown, heading east towards Lady Bird Lake. The bats<br>
			typically come out at sunset and can take anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour to fully empty the space under the bridge. It is truly an incredible<br>
			sight to see as Austin is home to the world's largest urban bat colony. Becauase of this, the city rarely suffers from pesky insects that normally would<br>
			plague other cities at Austin's latitude.</p>

			<p>Because of its hot and long summers, Austin's citizens are always trying to beat the heat during the summer months. Luckily, the city has two perfect water<br>
			sources for its residents to enjoy. The <strong>Colorado River</strong> and <strong>Lady Bird Lake</strong> both run through downtown and offer a perfect cooling<br>
			opportunity. Lining the sides of the river are numerous boating companies that allow people to kayak or paddle down the river, or, if they prefer, to simply<br>
			enjoy their lunch or dinner as they slowly cruise past downtown. Lady Bird Lake, located slightly east of downtown is a great place for people who are looking<br>
			for a little more privacy if they want to take a quick dip in the cooling waters.</p>

			<p>If you are looking to get out of the hustle and bustle of the downtown core, there are some perfect places for hiking that are just a short drive from the<br>
			city's hub. <strong>Barton Creek Wilderness</strong>, <strong>McKinney Falls State Park</strong>, and the <strong>Texas Hill Country</strong> located to the west<br>
			all offer incredible views of waterfalls, canyons, bluffs, natural pools and limestone cliffs. The natural pools in the area also present a perfect opportunity<br>
			to cool off on hot summer days.</p>

			<p>In keeping up with the outdoors trend, <strong>Zilker Park</strong> is one of the most well-known places to vist in the city. The park is usually used<br>
			for outdoor concerts and events due to its size and proximity to downtown. The park has disc-golf, volleyball sand pits, walking trails, boat rentals,<br> 
			its own theater and a miniature train that traverses around the park. In addition, Zilker Park also has Barton Springs Municipal Pool. The pool is 100%<br>
			spring water and is a perfect dip on hot days as its chilly water, even in peak summer months will leave those shivering and wanting to relax and dry<br>
			out on its shores.</p>

			<p><strong>The University of Texas</strong> has its main campus located in Austin, just north of downtown. The university is well known for being one of the<br>
			more accomplished schools in the state and in the country where they offer a wide range of subjects that produce many successful graduates. Visitors to the<br>
			university can go to the top of the UT tower and gaze out at the 360 degree panorama of the city and its surrounding neighborhoods. Or, they can partake in<br>
			Texas's main pasttime; football. The Texas Longhorns are a beloved team in a city that contains no professional sports teams. The Longhorns are the main<br>
			show and football games at Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium are a must for any sports fan.</p>

			<p>If you are looking for a peek into Texas's history, look no further than the <strong>Bullock Texas State History Museum</strong>. The museum is one the<br>
			finest ones in the entire state and focuses on the history of both Texas and Austin. The museum contains an interpretaive exhibit that rotates every few weeks,<br>
			an IMAX theater, a cafe and videos that showcase the history of the state. Due to the size of the museum, it is highly recommended to get there as early as possible.</p>

			<p><strong>The Texas State Capitol</strong> is one of the most prominent buildings in the Austin skyline. Due to its bronze color and its striking resemblance<br>
			to the U.S. Capitol, the Texas Capitol is easy to recognize from many parts of the city. Tours are available for inside the building and the grounds which the<br>
			building is located on is free to public access. Although, not used as the residence of the Governor of Texas as that title belongs to the Governor's Mansion<br>
			located just south of the Captiol grounds, the Texas Capitol is far more architecturally pleasing to the eye.</p>
